!> Calculate the Saturation Specific Humidity Scheme (Qsat): Vapour to Liquid/Ice.
!!
!! \details Heritage: Ops_Qsat.inc
!!
!! Returns a saturation mixing ratio given a temperature and pressure
!! using saturation vapour pressures caluclated using the Goff-Gratch
!! formulae, adopted by the WMO as taken from Landolt-Bornstein, 1987
!! Numerical data and Functional relationships in Science and
!! Technology.  Group V/Vol 4B Meteorology.  Physical and Chemical
!! properties of Air, P35.
!!
!! Value in the lookup table are over water above 0 degrees C and over
!! ice below this temperatures.
!!
!! Method: <br>
!!   uses lookup tables to find eSAT, calculates qSAT directly from that.

integer, parameter   :: N = ((T_high - T_low + (delta_T * 0.5_kind_real)) / delta_T) + one ! Size of lookup-table (gives 1551)

! Note: 0 element is a repeat of 1st element to cater for special case

!       rounded down due to machine precision.

  ! Compute the factor that converts from sat vapour pressure in a
  ! pure water system to sat vapour pressure in air, FSUBW.  This formula
  ! is taken from equation A4.7 of Adrian Gill's book: Atmosphere-Ocean
  ! Dynamics.  Note that his formula works in terms of pressure in MB and
  ! temperature in Celsius, so conversion of units leads to the slightly
  ! different equation used here.

  FSUBW = one + 1.0E-8_kind_real * P(I) * &
                          (4.5_kind_real+ 6.0E-4_kind_real * (T(I) - t0c) * (T(I) - t0c))

  ! use the lookup table to find saturated vapour pressure, and stored it in QS.

  TT = max (T_low, T(I))
  TT = min (T_high, TT)

  ATABLE = (TT - T_low + delta_T) / delta_T
  ITABLE = ATABLE
  ATABLE = ATABLE - ITABLE

  QS(I) = (one - ATABLE) * ES(ITABLE) + ATABLE * ES(ITABLE + 1)

  ! Multiply by FSUBW to convert to saturated vapour pressure in air (equation A4.6
  ! of Adrian Gill's book)

  QS(I) = QS(I) * FSUBW

  ! Now form the accurate expression for QS, which is a rearranged
  ! version of equation A4.3 of Gill's book.

  ! Note that at very low pressures we apply a fix, to prevent a
  ! singularity (Qsat tends to 1.0 kg/kg).

  QS(I) = (epsilon * QS(I)) / (max (P(I), QS(I)) - one_minus_epsilon * QS(I))

!! Values in the lookup table are over water above and below 0 degrees C.
!!
!! Note: For vapour pressure oever water this formula is valid for
!! temperatures between 373K and 223K.  The values for saturated vapour
!! over water in the lookup table below are out of the lower end of

  ! Compute the factor that converts from sat vapour pressure in a
  ! pure water system to sat vapour pressure in air, FSUBW.  This formula
  ! is taken from equation A4.7 of Adrian Gill's Book: Atmosphere-Ocean
  ! Dynamics.  Note that his formula works in terms of pressure in MB and
  ! temperature in Celsius, so conversion of units leads to the slightly
  ! different equation used here.

  FSUBW = 1.0 + 1.0E-8 * P(I) * (4.5 + 6.0E-4 * (T(I) - t0c) * (T(I) - t0c))

  ! use the lookup table to find saturated vapour pressure, and store it in QS

  TT = max (T_low, T(I))
  TT = min (T_high, TT)

  ATABLE = (TT - T_low + delta_T) / delta_T
  ITABLE = ATABLE
  ATABLE = ATABLE - ITABLE

  QS(I) = (1.0 - ATABLE) * ES(ITABLE) + ATABLE * ES(ITABLE + 1)

  ! Multiple by FSUBW to convert to saturated vapour pressure in air
  ! (equation A4.6 of Adrian Gill's book)

  QS(I) = QS(I) * FSUBW

  ! Now form the accurate expression for QS, which is a rearranged version of
  ! equation A4.3 of Gill's book.
  !
  ! Note that at very low pressures we apply a fix, to prevent a singularity
  ! (Qsat tends to 1.0 kg/kg)

  QS(I) = (epsilon * QS(I)) / (max (P(I), QS(I)) - one_minus_epsilon * QS(I))

!! if U is not positive definite this will be detected by the program and flagged
