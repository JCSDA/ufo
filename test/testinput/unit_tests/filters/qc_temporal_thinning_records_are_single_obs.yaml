# These tests are designed to check the behaviour of the `records_are_single_obs` thinning option
# together with its interaction with the use of a `category_variable`.

# There are eight profiles in the sample, each of which consists of two observations.
# Metadata values of the profiles are as follows:
# Location:   0,   1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8,   9,   10,  11,  12,  13,  14,  15
# times (s):  245, 246, 250, 251, 255, 256, 265, 266, 280, 281, 285, 286, 290, 291, 295, 296
# station ID: 1,   1,   2,   2,   3,   3,   4,   4,   5,   5,   6,   6,   7,   7,   8,   8
# category:   1,   1,   2,   2,   1,   1,   2,   2,   1,   1,   2,   2,   1,   1,   2,   2
# priority:   90,  90,  90,  90,  100, 100, 90,  90,  90,  90,  100, 100, 90,  90,  90,  90

# The centre of the window is 270 s.
# In the Temporal Thinning setup used, profiles at earlier times are retained.
