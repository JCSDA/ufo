 * \brief Computes the sampling locations and weights for a series of observations, assuming a
 * space-based sensor with a conical field of view.
 *
 * A FieldOfViewSampler object is associated with a particular sensor and satellite platform. It
 * computes a series of sampling locations associated with each observation from this sensor, these
 * samples serving to represent the extended field of view in the OOPS GeoVaLs interface. It also
 * computes the sampling weight associated with each sampling location.
 *
 * In principle, any number of methods could be used to compute the sampling locations and weights.
 *
 * The current implementation is an interface to the GSI `calc_fov` modules, acting as follows:
 *
 * - each observation's field of view forms an ellipse on the earth surface, centered on the
 *   observation's "location". A GSI subroutine is used to compute the ellipse.
 * - within this ellipse, a lat-lon grid is used for the sampling locations. The resolution of this
 *   lat-lon grid is set by requesting a particular number of points per semi-axis of the
 *   field-of-view ellipse.
 * - at each sample (= each point of the lat-lon grid that falls within the ellipse), a GSI
 *   subroutine is used to compute the sampling weight (= the GSI antenna power).
 *
 * WARNINGS -- Some known shortcomings of this design are:
 *
 * - close to the poles (within 2 degrees), where the lat-lon grid has a singularity, a SINGLE
 *   sample is used at the obs location, so no field-of-view effects are accounted for.
 * - the GSI code used by the FieldOfViewSampler class uses module-level variables in its
 *   computations. This means the UFO code written on top of this GSI code should not be considered
 *   thread-safe, because all FieldOfViewSampler objects point to the SAME memory in the GSI code.
 *   For this reason, access to the FieldOfViewSampler class is currently channeled through a
 *   helper method which adds mutex locks; this restores thread-safety when called correctly
 *   through the helper method, at the expense of runtime performance.
 *
 * NOTES -- Some considerations for future development are:
 *
 * - the FieldOfViewSampler class currently delegates to GSI code for computing the ellipse and
 *   weights of each observation, but this is not a fundamental restriction. It's mostly for the
 *   convenience of not porting over the large lookup tables of geometric factors and antenna power
 *   coefficients for each sensor.
 * - this class could be generalized to allow for different algorithms when computing the sampling
 *   locations and weights. For example a much simpler model of the underlying observation could be
 *   acheived by sampling the field of view ellipse with a few points located close to the obs
 *   location (where the antenna power is typically largest) and using a Gaussian falloff for the
 *   antenna power. This may or may not lead to worse H(x) than the current more complicated code.
 *   The class could also be extended to support switching between different sampling algorithms.
