/// \brief Observation operator for profile averaging.
///
/// This observation operator produces H(x) vectors which correspond to vertically-averaged
/// profiles. The algorithm determines the locations at which reported-level profiles
/// intersect each model pressure level. The intersections are found by stepping through the
/// observation locations from the lowest-altitude value upwards. For each model level,
/// the location of the observation whose pressure is larger than, and closest to, the model
/// pressure is recorded. The \p<vertical coordinate> parameter controls the model pressure
/// GeoVaLs that are used in this procedure.
/// If there are no observations in a model level, which can occur for (e.g.) sondes reporting in
/// low-frequency TAC format, the location corresponding to the last filled level is used.
/// (If there are some model levels closer to the surface than the lowest-altitude observation,
/// the location of the lowest observation is used for these levels.)
///
/// This procedure is iterated multiple times in order to account for the fact that model pressures
/// can be slanted close to the Earth's surface.
/// The number of iterations is configured with the \p<number of intersection iterations> parameter.
///
/// Having obtained the profile boundaries, values of model pressure and any simulated variables
/// are obtained as in the locations that were determined in the procedure above.
/// This produces a single column of model values which are used as the H(x) variable.
/// In essence, this operator converts a set of GeoVaLs to what is referred to as a 'CX column'
/// in OPS terminology.
///
/// In order for this operator to work correctly the ObsSpace must have been extended as in
/// the following yaml snippet:
///
/// - obs space:
///    extension:
///      allocate companion records with length: 71
///
/// (where 71 can be replaced by the length of the air_pressure_levels GeoVaL).
/// The H(x) values are placed in the extended section of the ObsSpace.
/// Note that, unlike what may be expected for an observation operator, averaging of the model
/// values across each layer is not performed; a single model value is used in each case.
/// This follows what is used in OPS. Alternatives could be considered in the future.
///
/// A comparison with OPS is be performed if the option \p<compare with OPS> is set to true.
/// This checks values of the locations and pressure values associated with the slant path.
/// All other comparisons are performed with the standard 'vector ref' option in the yaml file.
///
/// This operator also accepts an optional `variables` parameter, which controls which ObsSpace
/// variables will be simulated. This option should only be set if this operator is used as a
/// component of the Composite operator. If `variables` is not set, the operator will simulate
/// all ObsSpace variables. Please see the documentation of the Composite operator for further
/// details.
